The simulation is a 1C discharge, using a cell with a graphite anode and an NMC cathode. 
Microstructure properties for the cell were calculated from the tomography images 'Cal 1' and 'Cal 5' given in the following link:  https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/battery-microstructure-library-data.html
Parameters used for the simulation are provided. Unfortunately, the functions used for exchange current density and open cell potential are confidential, but similar results can of course be obtained with generic functions. 
The default solvers were used in both Pybamm and Comsol.
